# ZOMATO-RESTAURANT-ANALYSIS
Data Analysis Done on Microsoft Excel

I undertook a data analysis project for Zomato, focusing on the exploration and interpretation of restaurant data using Microsoft Excel. This project involved several key tasks:

Data Structuring: Organized and structured data across two tables with 20 attributes, identifying categorical and continuous variables for effective analysis.

Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values and inconsistencies, including filling in missing cuisine data, reformatting date columns, and converting foreign currency prices to Indian Rupees.

Statistical Analysis: Used advanced Excel functions, including COUNTIFS, XLOOKUP, and SUMPRODUCT, to extract meaningful insights such as restaurant distribution by price range, average voter count, and average ratings based on specific criteria.

Insightful Visualization: Created pivot tables and charts to represent restaurant distribution by country and year, aiding in the identification of potential markets for new restaurant openings with lesser competition.

Decision Support: Suggested strategic locations for new restaurants based on competition analysis, ratings, and expenditure. Emphasized the importance of focusing on local cuisines and optimizing menu pricing to enhance profitability.

Advanced Excel Techniques: Employed array formulas, conditional formatting, and lookup functions to streamline data analysis and visualization, providing clear and actionable insights.

This project allowed me to showcase my ability to clean and analyze complex datasets, derive strategic insights, and present findings in a clear and impactful manner.
